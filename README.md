beamer-sogang
===============

A pdfTeX beamer theme for the [Sogang University](http://sogang.ac.kr) in Korea 

1. Introduction
---------------

This beamer theme is a quick derivation from the [beamer-polymtl](https://github.com/mvonthron/beamer-polymtl) theme done by Manuel Vonthron. The color theme and watermarks have been changed to match the Sogang University colors. I have used this theme for presentations during the time when I worked at the Sogang University, however this theme has neither been approved for official used nor has it been reviewed by the faculty office. 

2. Installation
---------------

Clone the repository to your local texmf tree using

    git clone https://github.com/haechi/beamer-sogang.git
	
3. Usage
--------

Take a look at the included example file. Include the theme in your document preamble by

4. Files Included
-----------------

Color theme and beamer style is included. The image files were created using OmniGraffe on OS X. Source files are included.
